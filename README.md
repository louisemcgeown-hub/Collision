# Collision
Collision Data Project

This project aims to investigate the times and locations of traffic collisions in my town.
The csv file was received from the traffic engineer. I would like to look for patterns in the data.

For the moment, I have simply extracted a few data points and added them to an SQL database. This database
can be further processed to extract information such as the top ten causes for an accident (collision count.py)
